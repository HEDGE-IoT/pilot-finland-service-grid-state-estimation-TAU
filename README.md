## General Information and Purpose

**Service Name/Title**: State estimation  
**Description and Purpose**: Estimating the state variables of the grid.  
**Owner/Contact Information**: TAU

## Functional Requirements

- The system should be able to use the load and generation estimates.  
- The system should be able to run a power flow.  
- Provide estimation for grid state variables.  
- The system should be able to publish the calculation results to the message broker.  
- The system should be able to receive necessary data from the message broker.  

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Load and generation estimates should be available.  
- Grid data should be available.  
- Service is executed periodically (a few times per hour).  

---

## Service Interfaces

- **Visualization**:  
  - Forecasts and state estimations are visualized using **Grafana** (or similar tools).  
  - Grafanaâ€™s built-in HTTP API is used, requiring no additional custom interfaces.  
  - Visualization is based on **timeseries data** generated by the algorithms.

## Data Model

- **Entities and relationships**: (to be defined)  
- **Database schema**: (to be defined)  

---

## Integration and Dependencies

- **External dependencies**: Grid topology and characteristics, load and generation estimates  
- **System dependencies**: Message broker  
- **Third-party integrations**: Grafana, power flow solver  
- **HEDGE-IOT Edge Devices/interfaces and cloud services integration**  
- **Integration with the App Store**  
- **Integration with the data space**  

---

## Security and Privacy

- **Data Sensitivity**: Grid operation data and estimates must be protected.  
- **Access Control**: Access limited to authorized systems and users.  
- **Audit Logs**: All estimations, inputs, and outputs logged for traceability.  

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Stress testing**: Validate ability to handle multiple grid nodes and large datasets.  
- **Response times**: Estimations must be available within intra-hour execution deadlines.  

---

## Deployment and Environment

- **Configuration**: Parameters for power flow and state estimation configurable.  
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines for updates and deployment.  
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuous monitoring and logging of calculations and system health.  

---

## Testing and Validation

- **Test cases**: Estimations validated against SCADA or measured grid values.  
- **Automated testing tools**: Unit tests for algorithms, integration tests with data sources.  
- **Acceptance tests**: Benchmarking with known scenarios to verify accuracy and reliability.
